It is recommended to open it using Kaggle notebooks, as Conda is installed by defult and does not require any further installation. Kaggle notbooks was the cloud platform used for this development.\n\n3) Check the installation of the packages listed in the first cell.\n\n4) Run the cells sequentially, preferably using an accelerator, such as a GPU.\n\n\nProject developed for the NLP course of Intelligent Systems (Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.
