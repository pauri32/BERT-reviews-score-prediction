# BERT-reviews-score-prediction
Prediction of Amazon's reviews rating using a BERT model.

Structure of the project:
* **bertconfig**: Configuration of the pre-trained BERT model, downloaded from Hugging Face ([link](https://huggingface.co/google/bert_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12)).
* **amazon-cell-phones-reviews**: Dataset from Griko Nibras shared on Kaggle ([link](http://https://www.kaggle.com/grikomsn/amazon-cell-phones-reviews?select=20191226-reviews.csv)).
* **nlp-project.ipynb**: Notebook with the project.

## How to run the code

1) Download the files, including the *bertconfig* and *amazon-cell-phones-reviews* directories.

2) Open the notebook.

3) Run the cells sequentially, preferably using an accelerator, such as a GPU.
